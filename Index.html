        <p> Welcome to Takes from the fish bowl, a sports blog talking mainly about hockey 
and the Carolina Hurricanes. Hopefully you enjoy your stay and would like to read
more. I will be doing my best to keep this site up to date with articles for you to
read.

just to share with you! They are free for you to use all I ask for is that you give me
credit for the pictures!
