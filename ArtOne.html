            <b> The Bitter-Sweet Ending</b>
            <br>
            <br>

            After a 4-0 loss in Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Eastern Conference Finals to be the final time this season the Hurricanes took to the ice, they finished their series to the standing ovation of fans who at the end of December, lost hope of seeing extra hockey in April, let alone May. The Canes cleaning out their lockers with a lingering future of some players on this team, the main question being if this is the Captain Justin Williams last year not only on the team let alone the league. This decision is still in his hands, playing another full 82 game season producing 53 points during that season. While he lost his cool in the Conference Finals taking the lead on the team in penalty minutes, he has proved he can continue to be a consistent hockey player.

            However, being swept out of the Conference Finals hurts all of us, it should be hard to actually find justification to be angry, or disappointed in this team. Can you be upset at the special teams? Yes, despite having a few sparkling moments where it looked good but couldn’t buy a goal this year (Because you can look good on a power play but not score in case you didn’t know that). However, next season with Martin Necas most likely returning to the line up providing an actual right handed top power play forward.

            This season still has provided a positive outside of just how fans can look onto the season. A lot of free agents could watch the Hurricanes, and while making the playoffs, let alone the Conference Finals always produces interest of some big fish (yes this was on purpose) in Free Agency, some guys look at fans, and seeing what kind of atmosphere success in this market can bring, they may be more interested to take an offer from this team. The young talent helps as well. This team has a huge upside, this isn’t like years past, it is a young team, this team has a compeate level that looked unmatched when they were able to get on their game and get the bounces they need.

            Making the playoffs may have been a goal for the fans to just to be happy but when it comes to the professional athletes that's just a step to get to the goal which is lifting 35 lbs of silver over their head. This team has decisions to make this offseason to reach that final goal, this team may look different next year, it may look the same, but we can expect to see a seasoned team with a new hunger to reach the postseason again, and have a hunger to go further than they did during this year. The Canes play this year brought respect back to this market, and showed that not only the city of Raleigh, not only North Carolina, but both of the Carolinas are a hockey market. This team has a potential to be a team that every team struggles to come into our barn and not go into the opening faceoff thinking they have an easy edge. I will remember this season for the rest of my life, and to quote a hated final episode which was actually pretty good, some of y’all just like to hate watch the show, stories bring us together and there were plenty of those to get behind with the Hurricanes this year, bringing that family feel that the players felt even closer to our hearts.
